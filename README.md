Welcome to Saranya's Github!

"Hello World. This is my first GitHub project, I'm excited to learn." 

The above statement was my first entry into Github - written as part of an Introduction to Bioinformatics class I took in 2016 during my Master's at Johns Hopkins University. Now in 2025 almost 9 years later - I have evolved in my understanding of Python, Github and Bioinformatics and have decided to create a project portfolio to keep track of my coding skills. 

This README will serve as an index of the projects I work and give you detailed instructions on how to replicate my code.

1. Bioinformatics Projects
   1. reverse_complement: Find the reverse complement of a string.
   2. k-mers: Count k-mers of a given sequence. Input the sequence and the length of the k-mer.
